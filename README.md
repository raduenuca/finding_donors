# Finding Donors for CharityML
*Udacity - Machine Learning - Introduction Nanodegree Program*

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After sending nearly 32,000 letters to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians.

## Project goal

CharityML wants to build an algorithm to identify the best potential donors and reduce the overhead cost of sending mail. The goal of this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm is going to provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pands](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html) (v0.17)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You also need to have additional software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed, I highly recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
